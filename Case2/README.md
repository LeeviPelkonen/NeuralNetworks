## Case 2 Pneumonia X-ray image analysis


## Overview
The aim of this notebook is to predict whether a person is sufferring from a lung-condition called Pneumonia. The early-phase or minor pneumonia can be hard to spot by looking at a chest-xray with the naked eye. Severe cases show clear fogginess in the lung area.

In this notebook we use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to determine if a person has pneumonia.
