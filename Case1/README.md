## Case 1 Heart Disease Prediction


## Overview
The aim of this case is to predict the probability of heart disease occurrence using data mining techniques and machine learning algorithms. In this case we have used data sets that was collected by Cleveland Clinic Foundation in Switzerland.

## Dataset Information
The data is from UCI and can be found here link. The database contains 303 instances and 76 attributes, but in this case study only 14 attributes are used.
Attribute Information:

| Attribute | Details |
| :----------|:-------|
|age | age in years |
|sex | sex(1 = male; 0 = female) |
|cp | chest pain type (1 = typical angina; 2 = atypical angina; 3 = non-anginal pain; 4 = asymptomatic) |
|trestbps | resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital) |
|chol | serum cholestoral in mg/dl |
|fbs | fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false) |
|restecg | resting electrocardiographic results (0 = normal; 1 = having ST-T; 2 = hypertrophy |
|thalach | maximum heart rate  |
|exang | exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no) |
|oldpeak | ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest |
|slope | the slope of the peak exercise ST segment (1 = upsloping; 2 = flat; 3 = downsloping) |
|ca | number of major vessels (0-3) colored by  |
|thal | 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable  |
|num | the predicted attribute - diagnosis of heart disease (angiographic disease status) (Value 0 = < 50% diameter narrowing; Value 1 = > 50% diameter narrowing |
